# Requisite Discord Integration
Discord is one of, if not the most influencial and most widespread chatting platform on the market right now, and to do mod developers justice we've included a simple implementation of it's "GameSDK" into Requisite. If you'd like to read more on Discord's official documentation for the GameSDK, [click here.](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide)

Once you've read up on the GameSDK documentation, you can try out our implementation. All we provide is a natives downloader, meaning that everything else is completely up to you, as the developer. Unfortunately we can't give much insight into the inner-workings of the library, so you can find [it's GitHub repository here.](https://github.com/jncrmx/discord-game-sdk4j)
