# Crimson
## The ultimate Minecraft modding library.

## What is it?
Crimson is a developer-focused Minecraft modding library made to improve everyone's experience. At Qalcyo we want developers and users alike to have involvement in what they interface with.

It was made to revolutionize Minecraft modding and make it easier for everyone, and that's what we aim to achieve. It stays lightweight and simple enough for new developers to learn the basics of modding using it.
