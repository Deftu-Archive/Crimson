## What is it?
Requisite is a library for making MinecraftForge mods, including utilities for most needs and other commonly used components!

## Why should I use it?
There's no reason in specific. The library is just for your own QoL.

## How do I use it?
You simply import it into your project using Maven, Gradle or whatever :)

(I'm not teaching you how to do that if you're already making mods. I will block you if you DM me about it.)
